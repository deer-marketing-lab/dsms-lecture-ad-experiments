# Paid Search Effectiveness

---
# Are Paid Search Ads Effective?

**Motivation**: Is Search Engine Marketing Effective?

**Specific Questions**: 

* Does SEM generate a positive Return on Investment?
* Is SEM an informative or persuasive form of advertsing?

**How?**

* Controlled Experiments at eBay

Discussion Below draws from [Blake, Nosko and Tadelis](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA12423)

# Paid Search Ads - The 2012 edition

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/google_sem_nosko.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Brand Search Terms Experiment

**Brand Terms**: any queries that include the name of the brand 

* Examples: 'ebay shoes', 'de bijenkorf dress',

* Hypothesis: Users why type the brand name intend to go to that site anyway 
  * $\implies$ brand ads are intercepting what would otherwise be organic clicks

* Experiments: 
  * Experiment 1 (March to June 2012): Shutdown brand ads on MSN and Yahoo!
  * Experiment 2 (July 2012): Shutdown brand ads on Google

# Brand Search Terms Eyeconometrics


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/branded_search_fig.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* 99.5 % of click traffic is retained!
---
# Non-Brand Search Terms

**Non-Brand Search terms**: queries that do not include the name of the brand 

* Examples: 'shoes', 'long dress'

* Key difference: Users might not know product is available at a advertiser's website

* Hypothesis: Non brand ads steer consumers to advertiser's site 

* Experiment: Large scale Randomized Control Trial
  * Suspend non-brand ads in 30% of all DMAs in USA 
  * Control vs Test Split chosen via an algorithm
  * DMA: region of the US, roughly equivalent to a metro area

# Non-Brand Search Terms Eyeconometrics

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/nonbranded_search_fig.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Non-Brand Search Terms Econometrics 

Outcome of interest: Attributed Sales 

Method: Difference in Differences

$$
\ln(\textSales_it) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Treatment Group}_i + \beta_2 {Post}_t + \delta \text{Treatment Group}_i \times {Post}_t + \text{Fixed Effects} + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

**Coefficient of Interest**: \delta 

* (Why?)
* (How to Interpret?)

Note: Authors only report $\delta$ in the regression table

# Non Brand Search Terms Results 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/nonbranded_search_table.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Consumer Heterogeneity 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/heterogeniety.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Main Takeaways 

* Ads served via Brand Search terms are, on average, ineffective at bringing clicks to site 
* Ads served via Non-Brand Search terms are, on average, do not generate sales 
* Non-Brand Search terms might be effective for:
  * Consumers who do not purchase frequently on site 
  * Consumers who haven't purchased in a long time

Results are suggestive of Search Engine Ads being **informative**

* Discussion Q: Are the consumers for whom ads might be effective usually the type of consumers a firm would advertise to?

---
# Generalizability of Results?

How generalizable are the eBay results? 

* [Coviello, Gneezy and Goette (2017)](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/171148/1/cesifo1_wp6684.pdf) run the same experiments for a 'more representative company'
  * Company: [Edmunds](https://www.edmunds.com/)  
  * Experiment: Shutdown branded keyword ads on Yahoo and Bing
    * Split markets into 'Treatment' and 'Control'
  * Analysis: Difference in Differences 

---
# Generalizability of Results?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/ebay_generalizability.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Result: 5.6 percentage point reduction in total traffic
