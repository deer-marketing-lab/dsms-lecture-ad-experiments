# Business Problem

**Seeking answers to the following strategic questions:**

* How does my company get featured as a search engine ad?
* Are Brand based SEM ads effective at bringing traffic to my site?
* Are non-Brand based SEM ads effectice at generating sales?
* Are the effects heterogenous across consumers or companies?

**Data Driven answers** (to the last three): 

* Randomized Control Trials 
* Shutdown search engine ads
* Evaluate the effects using *Difference in Differences*

# Cost per click & Others 

Three options for bids:

1. **Cost-per-click (CPC)** 
  * How much you pay when a user clicks on your ad.
2. **Cost-per-mille (CPM)** 
  * How much you pay per 1000 ad impressions.
3. **Cost-per-engagement (CPE)**
  * How much you pay when a user performs a specific action on your ad (signs up for a list, watch a video, etc).

Remarks: 

* Search Engine maps each of these into a comparable number for the auction
* The average cost-per-click in the United States is typically between $1 and $2.

# Paid Search Effectiveness

# Are Paid Search Ads Effective?

**Motivation**: Is Search Engine Marketing Effective?

**Specific Questions**: 

* Does SEM generate a positive Return on Investment?
* Is SEM an informative or persuasive form of advertsing?

**How?**

* Controlled Experiments at eBay

Discussion Below draws from [Blake, Nosko and Tadelis](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA12423)

# Brand Search Terms Experiment

**Brand Terms**: any queries that include the name of the brand 

* Examples: 'ebay shoes', 'de bijenkorf dress',

* Hypothesis: Users who type the brand name intend to go to that site anyway 
  * $\implies$ brand ads are intercepting what would otherwise be organic clicks

* Experiments: 
  * Experiment 1 (March to June 2012): Shutdown brand ads on MSN and Yahoo!
  * Experiment 2 (July 2012): Shutdown brand ads on Google

# Brand Search Terms Eyeconometrics


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/branded_search_fig.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* 99.5 % of click traffic is retained!

---
class: font160
# Non-Brand Search Terms

**Non-Brand Search terms**: queries that do not include the name of the brand 

* Examples: 'shoes', 'long dress'

* **Key difference**: Users might not know product is available at a advertiser's website

* Hypothesis: Non brand ads steer consumers to advertiser's site 

* Experiment: Large scale Randomized Control Trial
  * Suspend non-brand ads in 30% of all DMAs in USA 
  * Control vs Test Split chosen via an algorithm
  * DMA: region of the US, roughly equivalent to a metro area

# Non-Brand Search Terms Econometrics 

**Outcome of Interest**: Attributed Sales 

**Method**: Difference in Differences

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln(\text{Sales}_{it}) = \beta_0 &+ \beta_1 \text{Treatment Group}_i + \beta_2 {Post}_t \\
  & + \delta \text{Treatment Group}_i \times {Post}_t + \text{Fixed Effects} + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{aligned}
$$

* $i$ is a DMA (region) of the US 
* $t$ is time (calendar date)

**Coefficient of Interest**: $\delta$ 

Discussion Questions:

* (Why is $\delta$ the coefficient of interest?)
* (How to Interpret?)
* (How does this framework compare to an A/B test?)

**Note**: Authors only report $\delta$ in the regression table

# Main Takeaways 

* Ads served via **Brand Search terms** are, **on average**, **ineffective** at bringing clicks to site 
* Ads served via **Non-Brand Search terms** are, **on average**, **do not generate sales** 
* **Non-Brand Search terms** **might be** effective for:
  * Consumers who **do not purchase frequently** on site 
  * Consumers who **haven't purchased in a long time**

Results are suggestive of Search Engine Ads being **informative**

**Discussion Q:** 

* Are the consumers for whom ads might be effective usually the type of consumers a firm would advertise to?

# Generalizability of Results?

How **generalizable** are the eBay results? 

* [Coviello, Gneezy and Goette (2017)](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/171148/1/cesifo1_wp6684.pdf) run the same experiments for a 'more representative company'
  * Company: [Edmunds](https://www.edmunds.com/)  
  * Experiment: Shutdown branded keyword ads on Yahoo and Bing
    * Split markets into 'Treatment' and 'Control'
  * Analysis: Difference in Differences

# Generalizability of Results?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}

knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Result: **5.6 percentage point reduction in total traffic**

# Recap

---
class: font140
# Summary

**How Are Search Engine Ads placed?**

* Displayed Search Engine Ads are the result of an auction between competing advertisers 
* Ad Ranks in auctions are the combination of a cost (per click) and a quality score 
* Ad prices are a function of the 2nd best bid's price and the winner's quality score

**Are Search Engine Ads Effective?**

* Evidence from experiments run by Ebay suggest on average search engine ads have a negative return on investment 
* ... Because on average they don't generate additional sales 
* But this effect might not be true for all firms 
  * We need more evidence ...
