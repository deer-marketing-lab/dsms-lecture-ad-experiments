# Measuring Advertising Response

**The goal of any marketing campaign is to increase sales** 

* Either short-term or long-term

`r icons:::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid"), scale = 1)`
**How to evaluate the performance of marketing?**

Each campaign / channel is evaluated on incremental profit that it produces relative to its cost 

$$
ROI = \frac{\text{incremental profit due to advertising} - \text{cost of advertising}}{\text{cost of advertising}}
$$

# What are Display Ads?

> A type of paid online advertising, display media consists of text, image, video, audio, and motion ads, which display on websites, apps, and social media platforms. These ads can appear in several sizes, including banner and reach users across the web.

"Measuring the online sales impact of an online ad or a paid-search campaign—in which a company pays to have its link appear at the top of a page of search results—is straightforward: We determine who has viewed the ad, then compare online purchases made by those who have and those who have not seen it."

# Cost Per Click & Friends 

Three options for bids:

1. **Cost-per-click (CPC)** 
  * How much you pay when a user clicks on your ad.
2. **Cost-per-mille (CPM)** 
  * How much you pay per 1000 ad impressions.
3. **Cost-per-engagement (CPE)**
  * How much you pay when a user performs a specific action on your ad (signs up for a list, watch a video, etc).

Remark: 

*  Each of these are converted to a comparable number for the auction

# What Ad to Show Instead? 

<br>

Two alternative sequences of ads have been studied:

1. **Public Service Ads**
  * Replace firm's ads with ads for NGO or charity
2.  An alternative "natural" sequence of ads
  * Called "**Ghost Ads**" in the literature

We'll talk through each methodology

# Public Service Ads Experiment

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/psa_main_idea.png")
```

Randomised Control Trial (i.e. an Experiment) 

* Users are split into two groups: 
  * **Control condition**
      * Users sees public service announcement ads - ads that help raise social awareness
  * **Treatment** (aka Test) **condition** 
      * Users see the company's ad as usual

---
class: font120
# Public Service Ads Experiment

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/psa_main_idea.png")
```

**Main idea:** 

By serving these real, alternative ads, we obtain the information on which users would have been exposed to the company's ad if the experiment did not allocate them to see PSA ads.


**Remark**:

To show the PSA alternative, you have to win the auction and choose to serve a different ad!

**Ghost Ads**: Identify ads among control group that *would have been* treatment ads *if* user was in treatment group

* **Treatment group**: user who see **your company's ad** (Macy's in this example)
* **Control group**: user sees **whatever ad platform chooses to deliver**

# Takeaways 

<br>

* Measuring display ad effectiveness is difficult

* Two experimental paradigms to measure casual effects:
  * Public Service Ads (PSAs)
  * Ghost Ads 

* Ghost Ads overcome the shortcomings from PSAs

# Search Engines Matter!

**Consumers use search engines**:

* 53% of all organic web traffic comes via search engines
* 32% of all traffic goes to first ranked page
* 91% of webpages get ZERO web traffic from Google
* 40% of purchases influenced by relevant search

**Firms respond**:

* Approx. US$100 billion spent on search ads in the US in 2022
  * This is almost 40 percent of all digital ad spending in the US

**Brand Terms**: any queries that include the name of the brand 

* Examples: 'ebay shoes', 'de bijenkorf dress',

*Hypothesis*: Users who type the brand name intend to go to that site anyway 

$\implies$ brand ads are intercepting what would otherwise be organic clicks

*Experiments*: 

* Experiment 1 (March to June 2012): Shutdown brand ads on MSN and Yahoo!
* Experiment 2 (July 2012): Shutdown brand ads on Google

# Non-Brand Search Terms

**Non-Brand Search terms**: queries that do not include the name of the brand

*Experiment*: Large scale *Geo* Experiment

* Suspend non-brand ads in 30% of all DMAs in USA 
* Control vs Test Split chosen via an algorithm
* DMA: region of the US, roughly equivalent to a metro area

# Analyzing Experiments Redux

**How to analyze this data?**: Treatment and Control units might differ systematically 

* i.e. average behaviour might differ

<br>

|                     | Before | After |
|---------------------|--------|-------|
| **Control Group**             | $\beta_0$      |  $\beta_0 + \beta_1$     |
| **Treatment Group**           | $\beta_0 + \beta_2$       |   $\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_1 + \delta$    |

$\delta$ is the effect of the experiment

# Estimating the Treatment Effect

| **Control Group**             | $\beta_0$      |  $\beta_0 + \beta_1$     |    $\beta_1$            |
| **Treatment Group**           | $\beta_0 + \beta_2$       |   $\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_1 + \delta$    |  $\beta_1 + \delta$               |
| **Treatment - Control** | |  |    $\delta$            |

<br>

$\implies$ We can estimate the **average treatment effect**

* if Treatment Group did not receive treaIment, average would also have increased by $\beta_1$

$\rightarrow$ This is *crucial* and *untestable*

# Main Takeaways 

* Ads served via **Brand Search terms** are, **on average**, **ineffective** at bringing clicks to site 
* Ads served via **Non-Brand Search terms** are, **on average**, **do not generate sales** 
* **Non-Brand Search terms** **might be** effective for:
  * Consumers who **do not purchase frequently** on site 
  * Consumers who **haven't purchased in a long time**

Results are suggestive of Search Engine Ads being **informative**

* Are the consumers for whom ads might be effective usually the type of consumers a firm would advertise to?

  * Company: [Edmunds](https://www.edmunds.com/)  
  * Experiment: Shutdown branded keyword ads on Yahoo and Bing
    * Split markets into 'Treatment' and 'Control'
  * Analysis: Difference in Differences

# Recap

---
class: font140
# Summary

**How Are Search Engine Ads placed?**

* Displayed Search Engine Ads are the result of an auction between competing advertisers 
* Ad Ranks in auctions are the combination of a cost (per click) and a quality score 
* Ad prices are a function of the 2nd best bid's price and the winner's quality score

**Are Online Display Ads Effective?**

* Ghost Ads presents an experimental framework to study causal effects of online display ads 
  * Creates a log entry where an ad wins an auction but shows the second ad 
  * i.e. a competitor in the ad auction 
  * Which is a "better" control group than serving PSA ads

---
class: font140
# Summary

**Are Search Engine Ads Effective?**

* Evidence from experiments run by Ebay suggest on average search engine ads have a negative return on investment 
* ... Because on average they don't generate additional sales

# Most Experiments Fail

**Main point of an experiment**:  test some idea 

* *not* proving something 

$\implies$ most experiments "fail"

* i.e. change does not lead to an improvement

**This is a good thing**

* Investment is typically small ...

* In publications, or 
* When talking to a firm
